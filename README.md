Stream Audio from various Sources

## Setup
First Start might be a bit buggy. Go to "Settings -> Set Token" and paste your Bot Token there, then go to "Settings -> Set Activity" and paste your Bot Activity in there. Lastly, go to "Settings -> Set Command Prefix" and set something like "s!" as your Bots Command Prefix.
Now restart the Bot with "SpookBot -> Restart" and the Bot should all be setup.
