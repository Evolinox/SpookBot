Basic Information will be in this README. For more specific questions or discussions, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/4a82kzPX3j) 

## Features
Working Graphical User Interface for easy Setup  
Stream Audio from various Sources  
Inspect Discord User Profiles  
Create a verification embed for new Members  

## Setup
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable the GUI on startup, add the "-g" Argument.

In the User Interface, go to "Settings -> Set Token" and paste your Bot Token there, then go to "Settings -> Set Activity" and paste your Bot Activity in there. Lastly, go to "Settings -> Set Command Prefix" and set something like "s!" as your Bots Command Prefix.
> [!TIP]
> Even though, the Command Prefix is deprecated with Slash Commands, it is still recommended to set one. Just in Case.

Now restart the Bot with "SpookBot -> Restart" and the Bot should all be setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are running SpookBot without a Graphical User Interface, make sure to run the .jar with -s first. This will invoke a Setup Process in the Console.
